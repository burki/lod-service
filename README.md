Status
------
This library is still very much work in progress.

* Currently, only a limited set of properties is implemented in the Model-classes.
* We aim to support multilingual labels and various date formats by switching to [data-values/time](https://packagist.org/packages/data-values/time) and multilingual text value from [data-values/common](https://packagist.org/packages/data-values/common).

Requirements
------------

* PHP 7.3 or higher
